# Getting Started

If you don't have gridsome installed run `npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

## Frontend

1. Clone the repo or run `gridsome create website https://github.com/u12206050/gridsome-firebase-starter.git` to create the site in a folder called `website`
2. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename to `.env.development`
3. Update the `.env.development` with your firebase credentials
4. `gridsome develop` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
5. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ

## Firebase

1. Run `npm install -g firebase-tools` [Firebase cli](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
2. Create your project folder `mkdir my-project`
3. Navigate to your project folder `cd my-project`
4. Run `firebase login`
5. Run `firebase init`

## Deploying your site

Update your enviroment variables in a file called `.env.production`

1. Build your static site `gridsome build``
2. Move the dist folder into your project directory as public `mv dist ../public`
3. To preview your static site run `firebase serve --only hosting`
4. Deploy the site to [Firebase hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/) run `firebase deploy --only hosting`

Tip: You can move your frontend project into your project folder for easier development ex. `my-project/website/` and then deploy with a single command within your website folder: `npm run deploy`

## Functions

On every Vue component/view you have access to the following:

  **`this.$db`**: Used for creating references and fetching data from Firestore. Same as `firebase.firestore()`

    Example: `this.$db.collection('documents').get().then(snapshot => console.log(snapshot.size))`

  **`this.$bind`**: Bind the results of a firestore reference to a property on the component

    Example: `this.$bind(this.$db.collection('documents'), 'documents')`: Now on `this.documents` you can access the documents and have the automatically be updated.

  **`this.$unbind`**: Unbinds the property so it no longer gets updates.

    Example: `this.$unbind('documents', null?): The 2nd argument is optional. To leave the property untouched in its current state leave out the `null`

  **`this.$functions`**: Most commonly used for creating requests to Firebase functions. Same s `firebase.functions()`

    Example: `this.$functions.httpsCallable('getTime')().then(time => console.log(time))`

  **`this.$auth**`**: This is extended on the `firebase.auth()` object which besides the `logout()` and `currentUser` methods and function it also has:

    `this.$auth.isLoggedIn`: If the user is logged in or not

    `this.$auth.userId`: The user id of the currently logged in user

    `this.$auth.roles`: An object of roles the user has been assigned

  **`this.$firestore`**: Contains the useful field properties to use when writing to db.

    `this.$firestore.GeoPoint`

    `this.$firestore.Timestamp`

    `this.$firestore.FieldValue`

## Other

  `npm run build`: Will build your project and test your **bundle size** according to the size limits set in `package.json`
